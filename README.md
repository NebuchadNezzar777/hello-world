# hello-world
My first experience on github

string name = "Kyle Everett";

std::cout << "Hello, my prefered moniker is " << name << " when I am forced into human interaction. I am currently studying at the University of Texas at Dallas towards a Bachelors in Software Engineering. The languages I prefer are python, perl, and c++, and sometimes english, again when I am forced into human interaction.\n";
